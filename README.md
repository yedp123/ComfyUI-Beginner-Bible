# **📖 ComfyUI Beginner Bible**

**An in-app, drag-and-drop dictionary for ComfyUI, designed specifically for absolute beginners and non-coders.**

If you are new to ComfyUI, the sheer number of nodes can be overwhelming. What does a "KSampler" do? Why do I need a "VAE Decode"? This extension adds a beautifully styled, searchable sidebar directly inside ComfyUI that translates 136 core nodes into plain, simple English.

*(Replace with an actual screenshot of your UI\!)*

## **✨ Features**

* **🧠 136 Nodes Explained Simply:** Ditch the technical jargon. Learn what each node does and exactly how to plug it in.  
* **🖱️ Native Drag & Drop:** Found the node you need? Just click and drag the card directly from the dictionary onto your canvas.  
* **👁️ Hover Previews:** Hover over any node in the list to instantly see a preview of its inputs (colored dots) and outputs.  
* **⌨️ Hotkey Ready:** Press **Alt \+ B** anytime to instantly slide the panel open or closed.  
* **🎨 V1 & V2 Compatible:** Integrates seamlessly into the classic ComfyUI menu or perfectly alongside the top-bar settings in the new ComfyUI V2 frontend (with an epic glowing button\!).
